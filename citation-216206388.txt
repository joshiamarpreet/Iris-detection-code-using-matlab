Kazakov, Todor. (2011). Iris Detection and Normalization. Biometric systems use the unique body and behavioural features of individuals for identity recognition and verification. Iris recognition systems particularly exploit the fact, that humans have unique patterns in their irises. For these to be recognizable by pattern matching algorithms, the iris tissue in images has to be isolated and transformed to a normalized form. In this report the detection and normalization problems are explored and time efficient solution algorithms are developed. The iris boundary detection algorithm is a hybrid approach of John Daugman's and Mahboubeh Shamsi's algorithms and uses their best features, providing efficient and accurate boundary detection. The initial objective of robustness and time efficiency was fulfilled, and the algorithm achieves ≈ 96% correct pixel detection with an average detection time of ≈ 0, 7 seconds. The detected region of interest-the isolated iris tissue, is unwrapped-converted from Cartesian to Polar coordinates, using a newly derived formula, based on Daugman's Rubber-Sheet model.
